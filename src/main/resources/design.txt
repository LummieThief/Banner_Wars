---BASICS---
Banners will not require a supporting block.
Banners that are broken will lose their pattern.
Banners with a pattern can be equipped in the helmet slot.
A banner with a pattern can only be placed by a player wearing a matching banner in their helmet slot.
When a banner with a pattern is placed in a chunk, it claims that chunk for 24 hours.
A claimed chunk can only be interacted with by a player wearing a matching banner in their helmet slot.
    *An exception to this rule is made for blocks that can store items, which can be interacted with by anyone.
TODO: Destroying a banner with a pattern will un-claim the chunk it was in.
TODO: When a claim's timer reaches 0, the banner that claimed it loses its pattern and the chunk becomes unclaimed.
Right-clicking a banner has the following effects:
    1. If the clicked banner has a pattern and the player who clicked it is wearing a matching banner in their helmet slot:
        TODO: The clicked banner's claim timer is refreshed to 24 hours.
    2. If the clicked banner has no pattern, the player who clicked it is wearing a banner, and the chunk containing the clicked banner is not already claimed:
        TODO: The clicked banner turns into the banner the player is wearing on their head, and it claims the chunk for 24 hours.
